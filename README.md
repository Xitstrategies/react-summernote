# react-summernote

## wrapping summernote in react to expose and handle all interactions with summernote

Limited list of features supported currently.
Not cleaning the HTML that is passed in, so there is still a risk with this tool.

## Use:

Clone the project and run ```npm install``` to load dependencies
I use npm http-server to host the example locally. ```npm install -g http-server```

To run the example page just execute ```http-server -o -p 8089```
